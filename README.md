- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt Robinson, currently working at Arrow Electronics (AIS) in sales operations.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and data science
- 🌱 I’ve recently learned SQL and data visualization tools, as well as the software for this space (like SQLite, MySQL, Github). Would like to grow and eventually learn Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are practical implications for the real world, eventually maybe some behavioral economics data
- 📫 How to reach me ... on here (if that's an option).
